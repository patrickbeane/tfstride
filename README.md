# tfSTRIDE & Policy Gate

`tfstride` converts Terraform plan JSON into reviewable cloud threat models, trust boundaries, STRIDE-oriented findings, and observed protective controls for AWS infrastructure before deployment.

## Overview

This project turns Terraform plan JSON into a cloud threat model for AWS infrastructure before deployment. It normalizes supported resources, identifies trust boundaries, evaluates rule-based STRIDE checks, and produces evidence-backed findings plus observed protective controls for human review and CI gating.

The engine is intentionally small and explainable: no LLMs in the core path, no full graph engine, and no runtime cloud access. The goal is to make risky infrastructure patterns easier to review before `terraform apply`.

## Features

- offline Terraform plan analysis with no LLM in the core pipeline
- trust-boundary detection plus STRIDE-oriented findings
- IAM graph resolution for inline policies, role attachments, and EC2 instance profiles present in the plan
- initial ECS/Fargate workload modeling via ECS service and task definition normalization
- resource-policy analysis for sensitive data services and invoke/publish/queue surfaces
- condition-aware narrowing for trust and resource policies using supported source constraints
- informational controls observed for clear mitigating signals
- machine-readable JSON output with stable finding fingerprints
- markdown and SARIF 2.1.0 output
- CLI rule registry listing in text and JSON for reviewable rule IDs, STRIDE categories, tags, and mitigations
- CI policy gating with `--fail-on low|medium|high`
- suppressions and baselines to focus gating on active new findings
- repo-level TOML config for provider selection, default gating, rule selection, and severity overrides
- automation-friendly `--quiet` mode and non-zero exit behavior
- zero runtime dependencies for the core CLI engine, with optional dashboard dependencies
- AWS-first analysis behind a provider registry with initial GCP inventory normalization

## Quickstart

Run directly from source:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m tfstride fixtures/sample_aws_plan.json
```

Install the CLI locally:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -e .
tfstride fixtures/sample_aws_plan.json --output threat-model.md
```

Generate a Terraform plan JSON from an infrastructure repo:

```bash
terraform plan -out tfplan
terraform show -json tfplan > tfplan.json
```

Gate a plan in CI and emit SARIF alongside the markdown report:

```bash
tfstride tfplan.json --quiet --fail-on high --output threat-model.md --sarif-output threat-model.sarif
```

Emit a machine-readable JSON report:

```bash
tfstride tfplan.json --quiet --json-output threat-model.json
```

Provider detection defaults to `auto`. For mixed-provider plans, select one provider explicitly:

```bash
tfstride tfplan.json --provider aws --quiet
tfstride tfplan.json --provider gcp --quiet --json-output threat-model.json
```

List the registered rules and their metadata without analyzing a plan:

```bash
tfstride --list-rules
tfstride --list-rules --json
```

The JSON report contract is versioned for downstream consumers. The current report payload uses:

- `kind: "tfstride-report"`
- `version: "1.1"`

Capture the current unsuppressed findings as a baseline and later gate only on new findings:

```bash
tfstride tfplan.json --quiet --baseline-output baseline.json
tfstride tfplan.json --quiet --fail-on high --baseline baseline.json
```

Use a checked-in repo config so CI and local runs share the same defaults:

```bash
tfstride tfplan.json --quiet
tfstride tfplan.json --config ./tfstride.toml --json-output threat-model.json
```

## Dashboard

The repo also includes a thin FastAPI dashboard in `apps/dashboard/`. It reuses the same engine, findings, and JSON contract as the CLI rather than adding a second analysis path.

Install the web dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -e '.[dashboard]'
```

Run the dashboard locally from the repo root:

```bash
uvicorn apps.dashboard.main:app --reload --port 8001
```

Useful routes:

- `/`: upload form for plan analysis
- `/scenarios`: built-in fixture gallery page
- `/demo/{scenario_id}`: built-in fixture scenarios such as `safe`, `mixed`, and `nightmare`
- `/analyze`: upload form POST target that renders an HTML report
- `/api/analyze`: multipart upload endpoint that returns the JSON report contract
- `/api/docs`: OpenAPI docs for the dashboard API
- `/healthz`: simple health endpoint for process and proxy checks

Deployment notes:

- a repo-tracked `systemd` unit example lives at `apps/dashboard/deploy/tfstride-dashboard.service`
- the checked-in example assumes the app lives at `/home/fleet/tfstride`, runs as user `fleet`, binds `uvicorn` to `127.0.0.1:8001`, and sets `PYTHONPATH` to the repo `src/` directory
- copy that unit to `/etc/systemd/system/tfstride-dashboard.service` on the host, then run `sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl enable --now tfstride-dashboard`
- a simple Caddy reverse-proxy example lives at `apps/dashboard/deploy/Caddyfile.example`

## Example Output

Example finding excerpt:

```markdown
#### Database is reachable from overly permissive sources

- STRIDE category: Information Disclosure
- Trust boundary: `workload-to-data-store:aws_instance.app->aws_db_instance.app`
- Severity reasoning: internet_exposure +2, data_sensitivity +2, lateral_movement +1, blast_radius +1, final_score 6 => high
- Evidence:
  - security group rules: aws_security_group.db ingress tcp 5432 from 0.0.0.0/0
  - network path: database trusts security groups attached to internet-exposed workloads
```

Expected outcome on a failing plan:

```text
Policy gate failed: 3 finding(s) meet or exceed `high` (3 high).
```

## CI Usage

GitHub Actions example with SARIF upload and high-severity gating:

Policy gating returns exit code `3` when findings meet or exceed the requested threshold.

```yaml
name: threat-model

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      actions: read
      contents: read
      security-events: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: "3.11"
      - run: python -m pip install -e .
      - run: terraform plan -out tfplan
      - run: terraform show -json tfplan > tfplan.json
      - run: tfstride tfplan.json --quiet --fail-on high --sarif-output tfstride.sarif
      - uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
        if: always()
        with:
          sarif_file: tfstride.sarif
```

Pre-apply gating example:

```bash
terraform plan -out tfplan
terraform show -json tfplan > tfplan.json
tfstride tfplan.json --quiet --fail-on medium --output threat-model.md --sarif-output threat-model.sarif
terraform apply tfplan
```

## Demo Scenarios

The repo includes several ready-to-run Terraform plan fixtures:

- `sample_aws_alb_ec2_rds_plan.json`: public ALB, private EC2 app tier, and private encrypted RDS to demonstrate a composed transitive data-path finding on a common web architecture
- `sample_aws_baseline_plan.json`: mostly segmented environment with a deliberate IAM hygiene issue and a non-obvious private-data path to demonstrate the baseline detector surface
- `sample_aws_cross_account_trust_unconstrained_plan.json`: minimal cross-account assume-role trust without narrowing conditions to exercise the IAM trust finding path
- `sample_aws_cross_account_trust_constrained_plan.json`: similar cross-account trust narrowed by `ExternalId`, `SourceArn`, and `SourceAccount` so the report surfaces the control instead of the finding
- `sample_aws_ecs_fargate_plan.json`: ECS service and task definition coverage for Fargate-style workloads, task roles, execution roles, and private data access
- `sample_aws_lambda_deploy_role_plan.json`: private Lambda deployment path with scoped S3 access and deliberate cross-account trust to exercise IAM and trust findings without public-network noise
- `sample_gcp_plan.json`: Google provider smoke fixture that auto-selects GCP and normalizes the initial compute, network, IAM, Cloud SQL, Secret Manager, Cloud KMS, and storage inventory set
- `sample_aws_safe_plan.json`: private-by-default reference environment with protected storage, private database access, and no active findings
- `sample_aws_plan.json`: mixed case with public exposure, permissive database reachability, risky IAM, and cross-account trust
- `sample_aws_nightmare_plan.json`: deliberately broken environment with stacked public access, public storage, wildcard IAM, risky workload roles, and blast-radius expansion

## Architecture

Input:

- Terraform plan JSON generated by `terraform show -json`

Pipeline:

1. Parse the Terraform plan into raw resource records.
2. Auto-select the provider, normalize supported resources into a provider-agnostic internal model, and decorate in-plan AWS relationships such as role attachments, resource policies, route-table posture, and public-access blocks.
3. Build shared analysis indexes for role lookup, security-group membership, public workloads by security group, and attached security groups.
4. Detect trust boundaries such as internet-to-service, public-to-private segmentation, workload-to-data-store access, control-plane-to-workload relationships, and cross-account trust.
5. Evaluate rule-based STRIDE checks through a `RuleEvaluationContext` that carries the inventory, boundary index, rule registry, rule policy, and shared analysis indexes.
6. Observe clear risk-reducing controls.
7. Render markdown and optionally JSON or SARIF output.

The engine is intentionally simple and explainable:

- trust boundaries model crossings that matter for review rather than a full graph engine
- rules operate on normalized infrastructure facts, not raw Terraform JSON
- severity uses a small additive model across internet exposure, privilege breadth, data sensitivity, lateral movement, and blast radius

Current trust boundary types:

- `internet-to-service`
- `public-subnet-to-private-subnet`
- `workload-to-data-store`
- `cross-account-or-role-access`
- `admin-to-workload-plane`

Current rules include:

- internet-exposed compute with overly broad ingress
- databases reachable from public or otherwise permissive sources
- unencrypted RDS storage
- public S3 exposure
- sensitive resource policies that allow public or cross-account access
- service resource policies that allow public or cross-account access
- wildcard IAM privileges
- workload roles with sensitive permissions
- missing segmentation between public workloads and private data tiers
- sensitive data tiers transitively reachable from internet-exposed paths
- broad or cross-account control-plane paths that reach workloads with private database or secret access
- trust relationships that expand blast radius
- cross-account or broad trust without narrowing conditions
- public and high-privilege GCP project IAM principals
- public Cloud SQL authorized networks, public IPv4/private-network posture, SSL enforcement, backups, point-in-time recovery, and deletion protection
- broad or external GCP IAM access to Secret Manager secrets and Cloud KMS keys
- internet-exposed GCP workloads whose service accounts can access GCS, Secret Manager, Cloud KMS, or Cloud SQL

Outputs include:

- summary counts and discovered trust boundaries
- findings grouped by severity with rationale, mitigation, evidence, and severity reasoning
- controls observed when the engine sees clear mitigating signals such as S3 public access blocks, narrowed trust, or private encrypted RDS
- analysis coverage showing resource coverage, unsupported types, rule posture, finding counts, and unresolved in-plan references
- JSON output with normalized resources, findings, observations, fingerprints, and filtering summary
- markdown for human review
- SARIF 2.1.0 for scanner-compatible integrations

### Internal Modeling Notes

- `ResourceMetadata` and `InventoryMetadata` define typed metadata fields for normalized and inventory-level enrichment.
- New provider-specific or decorator-derived facts should usually be added as typed metadata fields and accessed through `get_metadata_field()`, `set_metadata_field()`, or `append_metadata_field()`.
- `NormalizedResource` properties are reserved for stable, broadly used normalized concepts such as network posture, public exposure, identity relationships, and data sensitivity.
- `AnalysisIndexes` is computed once from the inventory and reused by trust-boundary detection and rule detectors. Add shared lookup needs there instead of rebuilding detector-local maps.
- `resource_concepts.py` centralizes conceptual resource groups and predicates such as workloads, data stores, public edges, identity roles, and security groups. Prefer those helpers over scattered hard-coded resource-type sets when the semantics match exactly.

## JSON Contract

The JSON report is intended to be the stable machine interface for future dashboards and automation.

Top-level sections:

- `kind`
- `version`
- `tool`
- `title`
- `analyzed_file`
- `analyzed_path`
- `summary`
- `filtering`
- `analysis_coverage`
- `inventory`
- `trust_boundaries`
- `findings`
- `suppressed_findings`
- `baselined_findings`
- `observations`
- `limitations`

Contract notes:

- additive fields may appear within the same major version
- breaking structural changes should increment the major version
- `inventory.resources` and `trust_boundaries` are serialized in stable sorted order for downstream consumers
- `analysis_coverage` summarizes parsed resource coverage, enabled rules, severity overrides, finding counts by rule, and unresolved in-plan references

## Suppressions And Baselines

Suppressions are explicit, reviewable exceptions. The CLI accepts a JSON file with one or more selectors such as `rule_id`, `resource`, `trust_boundary_id`, `severity`, `title`, or `fingerprint`.

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "suppressions": [
    {
      "id": "accept-cross-account-trust",
      "rule_id": "aws-role-trust-expansion",
      "reason": "Tracked in SEC-123 until the deploy role is narrowed."
    }
  ]
}
```

Baselines are generated by the tool and keyed by stable finding fingerprints so CI can focus on newly introduced findings:

```bash
tfstride tfplan.json --quiet --baseline-output baseline.json
tfstride tfplan.json --quiet --baseline baseline.json --fail-on high
```

## Repo Config

The CLI auto-discovers `tfstride.toml` from the current working directory or the plan file directory. You can also pass it explicitly with `--config`.

CLI flags still win over config values when both are present.

Example:

```toml
version = "1.0"
title = "Platform Threat Model"
provider = "auto"
fail_on = "high"
baseline = ".tfstride/baseline.json"
suppressions = ".tfstride/suppressions.json"

[rules]
disable = ["aws-role-trust-expansion"]

[rules.severity_overrides]
aws-iam-wildcard-permissions = "low"
```

Supported config keys:

- `title`
- `provider`
- `fail_on`
- `baseline`
- `suppressions`
- `rules.enable`
- `rules.disable`
- `rules.severity_overrides`

## Supported AWS Resources

The MVP intentionally supports a focused resource set:

- `aws_instance`
- `aws_ecs_service`
- `aws_ecs_task_definition`
- `aws_ecs_cluster`
- `aws_security_group`
- `aws_security_group_rule`
- `aws_nat_gateway`
- `aws_lb`
- `aws_db_instance`
- `aws_s3_bucket`
- `aws_s3_bucket_policy`
- `aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block`
- `aws_iam_role`
- `aws_iam_policy`
- `aws_iam_role_policy`
- `aws_iam_role_policy_attachment`
- `aws_iam_instance_profile`
- `aws_lambda_function`
- `aws_lambda_permission`
- `aws_kms_key`
- `aws_sns_topic`
- `aws_sqs_queue`
- `aws_secretsmanager_secret`
- `aws_secretsmanager_secret_policy`
- `aws_subnet`
- `aws_vpc`
- `aws_internet_gateway`
- `aws_route_table`
- `aws_route_table_association`

Unsupported resources are skipped and called out in the report.

## GCP Support

The GCP provider is registered for provider detection and supports initial inventory normalization for `google_compute_instance`, `google_compute_network`, `google_compute_subnetwork`, `google_compute_firewall`, `google_compute_route`, `google_compute_router`, `google_compute_router_nat`, `google_compute_forwarding_rule`, `google_compute_global_forwarding_rule`, `google_project_iam_member`, `google_service_account`, `google_service_account_key`, GCP service-account IAM member/binding/policy resources, `google_sql_database_instance`, `google_secret_manager_secret`, Secret Manager secret IAM member/binding/policy resources, `google_kms_crypto_key`, Cloud KMS crypto-key IAM member/binding/policy resources, `google_storage_bucket`, and GCS bucket IAM member/binding/policy resources.

GCP trust-boundary detection currently covers internet-to-service exposure for public compute, external forwarding rules, Cloud SQL, and GCS buckets, network route and Cloud NAT subnet posture, plus workload-to-sensitive-data paths from GCE service accounts to GCS, Secret Manager, Cloud KMS, and Cloud SQL. GCP STRIDE rule coverage currently includes public compute broad ingress, public Cloud SQL authorized networks, public IPv4/private-network posture, SSL enforcement, backup and recovery posture, deletion protection, public GCS bucket access, GCS uniform access, Public Access Prevention, versioning, and customer-managed encryption posture, broad or external IAM access to Secret Manager secrets and Cloud KMS keys, internet-exposed workloads with sensitive data access, broad project IAM principals, and high-privilege project role bindings; GCP controls observed are not implemented yet.

## Limitations

- AWS remains the deepest provider implementation and the only provider with control-observation coverage today
- GCP support is limited to initial inventory normalization, internet-to-service, route/NAT posture, workload-to-sensitive-data trust-boundary detection, and first-pass GCP STRIDE rules for selected core resource types
- Azure provider support is not registered yet
- deliberately incomplete Terraform resource coverage
- subnet classification prefers explicit route table associations when available, but does not model main-route-table inheritance or every routing edge case
- IAM analysis focuses on inline policies, standalone policies, role-policy attachments, and trust policies rather than a full attachment graph
- supported condition narrowing is intentionally focused on keys such as `SourceArn`, `SourceAccount`, and `ExternalId` rather than every service-specific authorization condition
- no runtime validation, cloud API calls, or drift detection
- no architecture diagrams or graph visualization

## Testing

Run the unit tests:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
```

## Why This Project Exists

Terraform plans are readable, but they are still easy to misjudge when network posture, IAM trust, and data-tier exposure interact. This project exists to make those paths explicit with repeatable analysis, concrete evidence, and CI-friendly outputs.

It is intentionally scoped to a small AWS-first surface area so the output stays understandable and stable rather than pretending to be a full cloud policy engine.
